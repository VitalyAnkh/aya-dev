Application of efficient sorting in proof assistants:

+ [Arend ring solver]: tree sort

Non-applications, due to these languages not having efficient sorting:

+ [Lean ring solver]: bubble sort
+ [Agda ring solver]: bubble sort

The sorting happens during normalization, while in Arend, we first normalize without sorting, and then sort the normal form.
